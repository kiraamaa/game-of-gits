House Stark of Winterfell is led by the just Eddard "Ned" Stark, Lord of
Winterfell, Warden of the North, Hand of the King, Protector of the Realm,
Regent.  He is surely honorable and will lead a long and prosperous life.

Ned Stark ultimately journeys to Kings Landing, vacations seaside for
for a month, and returns home with presents for his children.
He celebrates his return with cake and sloppy direwolf kisses.
